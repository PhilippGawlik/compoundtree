# INSTALLATION
- programmed by using Â´python 2.7.6`
- please install necessary third-party packages by using `pip -r requirements.txt` 
- dot command line tools are required and must be installed. Please see [Graphviz](www.graphviz.org) for more information
- [evalb](http://nlp.cs.nyu.edu/evalb/) is used for evaluation of the PCFGs and is included in `compoundtree` package

# GENERAL USAGE INFORMATION

- demo usage:
	- cd script
	- `bash parse_segmented_nouns.sh`
	- `bash evaluate_pcfg.sh`
	- `bash clean.sh`
- in the following a brief overview of the main packages is given. Find more information in the thesis .pdf that is also includes in this repository. Also check the file comments of the modules.
- the compoundtree corpus can be found in `corpora/trees`

# PACKAGES

## bitpar

- package includes [bitpar project](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/BitPar/) as well as helper scripts to prepare the input, the lexicon and grammar for the use of bitpar parser
- to prepare the bitpar input use `prepare_bitpar_input.py`
- to assemble a grammar (needed for bitpar parsing) from the `compoundtree` corpus use `grammar.py`
- to assemble a lexicon (needes for bitpar parsing) from the `compoundtree` corpus use `lexicon.py`
- use `parse_list.py` to parse a list of compounds with bitpar

## corpora

- holds several kinds of corpora
- `bitpar/` folder holds files supporting bitpar parser
- `evalb/` folder holds evaluation files generated by evalb
- `trees/` folder holds tree representation files
- `words/` folder holds several word source files 

## pcfg_evaluation

- `pcfg_evaluation.py` provides a procedural example of the use of the `pcfg` package
- holds scripts necessary for processing PCFGs
- `annotate.py` script allows to annotate tree nodes with parent, head, lex and a mixture of these annotation styles
